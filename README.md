**Breakdown the mathematics for computer science and implementation**

## Introduction
> Mathematics is the root for Computer Science and there are still syllabus and tutorial focusing only only on the programmatic part of the Computer Science. 

*Mathematics are the notes for the music of the Computer Science. You can even play music without knowing the notes, but then you are not a musician.*

This Repository contains all the necessary mathematical model, proofs, algorithms, principles, concepts,.. and so on from basic to advanced. (Note: *Not only for Computer science perspective but for general one.*

**Most of the Concepts are been studied in schools and universities, eventhough people fail to understand them from basic - But in this repository I had examples and pictures and practical demo for every model using computer programs and stimulation for easy understanding**

## Prerequistics

*For using the example codes in this tutorials and to understand some concepts there are some prerequistics to be considered on*

1. English 
2. Python basic
3. C basics
